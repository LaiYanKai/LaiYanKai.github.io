LOG from 16 Dec 2019
--- 18 Dec 2019 ---
1. Completed JPS with relevant options except for connectivity. With basic path illustration and console logging for debugging purposes.
2. Fixed a shortcut in Dijkstra that may result in non-optimal paths. Specifically, the shortcut to goal if it is a neighbor. Removed this and will find goal only after extracting from unvisited list.
3. CSS: min-width for small screens changed from 600px to 1200px
4. Added new map DENSEA_21_21 "Dense-A (21, 21)"
5. Added name property for maps
6. Renamed AStar.js to Astar.js because of renaming issues from Github
